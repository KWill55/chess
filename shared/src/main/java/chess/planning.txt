Understanding how these files work together:

ChessBoard.java - represents the chessboard
* holds pieces in 8x8 grid of chessPiece objects
* methods to rearrange pieces
* stores state of board

ChessGame.java - manages game logic
* tracks player turn
* coordinates moves on ChessBoard
* validates moves using PieceMovesCalculator and ChessMove
* updates board by calling methods in ChessBoard after each move

ChessMove.java - single move
* stores start/end positions of the piece chosen
* stores piece being moved
* captured pieces?

ChessPiece - represents chess piece
* stores type and color of chess pieces
* PieceMovesCalculator needs to know piece type to determine valid moves

ChessPosition - represents a single square within squares (board)
* stores row and column of the square
* ChessMove and ChessBoard uses this to track positions

PieceMovesCalculator
* determines legal moves for chess pieces
* maybe use an enum?



Plan of attack:
1. make board with pieces on it (ChessBoard and ChessPiece)
2.
